            <p> The nametag, a project that 
                refelects how you idenitify yourself. 
                this project not only did I 
                idenitify myself but my personality as well.

            <p> Have you every experinced a toy that was
                so frustrating to understand and finish?
                That was me with the Etch-A-Sketch toy
                I had back when I was probably 5 years old.
                I always wanted to know how to draw on it
                but I deemed it too diffucult. Why don't you
                try my Etch-A-Sketch I made. <a href=https://whitleybhdarby.github.io/whitley-darby-toy-proj-6/index.html>Link!</a>

            <p> Music, it is the universal language.
                Music is my whole world. I make sure I always
                have my ears glogged with my favorite song.
                One of my favorites is One Way St by Jhen√© Aiko.
                All her songs take me to a whole other planet
                so in this project I transport you the what I 
                see/feel when I listen to her song. <a href=https://whitleybhdarby.github.io/whitley-darby-expressive-text-proj-4/index.html>Link!</a>
