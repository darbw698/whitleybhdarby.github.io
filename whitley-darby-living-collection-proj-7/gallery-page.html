            <p> Have you every experinced a toy that was
                so frustrating to understand and finish?
                That was me with the Etch-A-Sketch toy
                I had back when I was probably 5 years old.
                I always wanted to know how to draw on it
                but I deemed it too diffucult. Why don't you
                try my Etch-A-Sketch I made. <a href=https://whitleybhdarby.github.io/whitley-darby-toy-proj-6/index.html>Link!</a>

            <p> Music, it is the universal language.
                Music is my whole world. I make sure I always
                have my ears glogged with my favorite song.
                One of my favorites is One Way St by Jhené Aiko.
                All her songs take me to a whole other planet
                so in this project I transport you the what I 
                see/feel when I listen to her song. <a href=https://whitleybhdarby.github.io/whitley-darby-expressive-text-proj-4/index.html>Link!</a>

                annoying but so powerful for people like me. To showcase

            <p> Women are powerful and Helen reddy let all women 
                around the world witness that with her song ‘I Am Women’. 
                When this song came out there was going to be a women’s 
                strike in New York and other states to protest inequality 
                between men and women.
