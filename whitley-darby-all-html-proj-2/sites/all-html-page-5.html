        <h1>The reason for this project</h1>

<p><i>begining</i> this is to teach myself and others how to us just html instead and what it has to offer.</p>

<p>The <i>html part of making</i> is the building block of everything. Without it there could be no CSS or Javascript
    they would have no point of it what so ever.</p>
